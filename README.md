# Lab 3 - ChatWParse

ChatWParse is an app to build a chat client using Parse to explore the features of its ORM and backend service. 

Learned: We'll find that the ORM has many parallels with Core Data, the iOS persistence framework. We'll explore how to work with schema, creating and querying objects, and user authentication.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total
